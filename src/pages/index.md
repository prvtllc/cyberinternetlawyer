        Although some computer forensics experts focus solely on the use of certain automated software to collect evidence, we believe that a competent computer forensics analyst or expert in Virginia must be equipped to do more.  There are attorneys and other professionals that understand how digital evidence works.  If your Virginia computer forensics expert can't answer simple questions regarding the operations of forensic software packages, you may be at a disadvantage in terms of credibility.  Therefore, our Virginia computer forensics experts have not only experience in recovering and analyzing digital evidence, but also advanced technology degrees and impressive resumes to go along with them.

        Our approach and qualifications as Virginia computer forensics experts will also prove to be of assistance to businesses and individuals in civil or criminal litigation.  From a civil perspective, a victim of computer trespass (or computer hacking) may utilize our services to track down the culprit.  Whether the unauthorized access came from a former employee, a business competitor, or even a former spouse, we may help the corporation or law firm to track down those responsible.

        A Virginia computer forensics expert can also assist individuals accused of a Virginia computer crime.  Whether the individual is accused of hacking, computer trespass, computer fraud, use of a computer to solicit a police officer posing as a minor, or the alleged possession of illegal pornography, our expertise can be critical in formulating a competent strategy.  We can assist your attorney in understanding the many issues where digital evidence will come into play.  Recognizing problems in the government's case may be the difference in determining whether an innocent individual will go to prison or not.  It can also be the difference in determining whether a guilty individual will be offered a fair resolution or a life sentence.  The digital evidence analysis skills of a Virginia computer forensics expert are therefore critical.  Our expertise extends to mobile digital devices.
