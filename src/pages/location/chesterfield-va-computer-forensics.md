Below, weâ€™ll take a look into **Chesterfield Computer Forensics** expert assistance for cases.

In criminal cases, the Commowealth's attorney may present a cyber forensics expert who may be employed by the police or the Attorney General.  In turn, the defense may (or should) have its own expert to assist the defense attorney in presenting a defense and explaining to the Judge and/or jury some of the complexities involved in digital evidence to raise reasonable doubt.

## Chesterfield Computer Forensics Cases

These are some cases decided in Chesterfield where computer forensics played an important part. This list is being periodically updated.

[HARRISON v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia Court of Appeals, OCTOBER 13, 2015](https://www.cyberforensics.tech/defendant-convicted-after-skipping-computer-forensics) - Defense counsel filed a post-trial motion to set aside the verdict, alleging a violation of his due process rights. Apparently the prosecution agreed to nolle prosequi or dismiss the charges if the defendant received treatment. As a result, the defendant did not hire a computer forensics expert to retrieve recently deleted electronic communications from the complainant to the defendant. The defense argued that the digital evidence was essential to the defense.
