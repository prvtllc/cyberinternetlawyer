Below, we’ll take a look into **Virginia Beach Computer Forensics** expert assistance for cases.  In Virginia Beach, the Courts often listen to expert witness testimony in the field of digital forensics.  In criminal cases, the Commowealth's attorney may present a cyber forensics expert who may be employed by the police or the Attorney General.  In turn, the defense may (or should) have its own expert to assist the defense attorney in presenting a defense and explaining to the Judge and/or jury some of the complexities involved in digital evidence to raise reasonable doubt.

## Virginia Beach Computer Forensics Cases

These are some cases decided in Virginia Beach where computer forensics played an important part. This list is being periodically updated.

[MIDGETTE v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia Court of Appeals, OCTOBER 30, 2018](https://www.cyberforensics.tech/traffic-stops-perjury-and-computer-forensics) - The case began as a traffic stop. The defendant was ultimately convicted of perjury for allegedly doctoring a video in support of his testimony disputing that a traffic light was not red when he was stopped. The lack of authenticity of the video was established through the testimony of the Commonwealth’s computer forensics expert.

[Scott v. United States, Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, 2018](https://www.cyberforensics.tech/android-device-forensics-to-identify-email-owner-in-virginia) - The defendant did not retain his own computer forensics expert despite the government presenting several items of evidence through it's own digital evidence examiner. Part of the alleged conspiracy ocurred when a Ms. Banks testified that when she was living in Virginia Beach, an unknown woman contacted her via Facebook and asked her if she wanted to make some money by hosting hotel parties.  [Domingo Rivera, a Virginia digital forensics expert and attorney](https://www.forensicsvirginia.com/scott-v-united-states-forensics-to-identify-defendant.html) provides some discussion regarding the issues raised by this case.
