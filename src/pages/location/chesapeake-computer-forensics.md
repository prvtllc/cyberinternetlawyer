Below, weâ€™ll take a look into **Chesapeake Computer Forensics** expert assistance for cases.  In Chesapeake, the Courts often listen to expert witness testimony in the field of digital forensics.  In criminal cases, the Commowealth's attorney may present a cyber forensics expert who may be employed by the police or the Attorney General.  In turn, the defense may (or should) have its own expert to assist the defense attorney in presenting a defense and explaining to the Judge and/or jury some of the complexities involved in digital evidence to raise reasonable doubt.

[Scott v. United States, Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, 2018](https://www.cyberforensics.tech/android-device-forensics-to-identify-email-owner-in-virginia) - The defendant did not retain his own computer forensics expert despite the government presenting several items of evidence through it's own digital evidence examiner. Part of the alleged conspiracy ocurred when a Ms. Latouche testified that when she was living in Chesapeake with her mother, an unknown woman contacted her via Facebook and asked her if she wanted to make some money by hosting hotel parties.
