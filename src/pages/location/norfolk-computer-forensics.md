Below, we’ll take a look into **Norfolk Computer Forensics** expert assistance for cases.  In Norfolk, the Courts often listen to expert witness testimony in the field of digital forensics.  In criminal cases, the Commowealth's attorney may present a cyber forensics expert who may be employed by the police or the Attorney General.  In turn, the defense may (or should) have its own expert to assist the defense attorney in presenting a defense and explaining to the Judge and/or jury some of the complexities involved in digital evidence to raise reasonable doubt.

**Some examples of criminal cases normally requiring the assistance of a Norfolk digital forensics expert include:**
* Computer fraud under Va. Code Sec. 18.2-152.3 charges in Norfolk.
* Computer trespass under Va. Code Sec. 18.2-152.4 or violations of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC 1030, which may be charged in Norfolk or at the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia
* 18.2-374.3 Use of communications devices to facilitate offenses involving minors also known as computer solicitaion of a minor in Norfolk

* Unauthorized transmission of bulk or unsolicited email (SPAM) under the Virginia Computer Crimes Act 
* Cyber stalking, computer harassment.

In civil litigation in the Norfolk Courts, a forensics expert for a party examines the evidence in the case and may present a report with findings for the attorneys or the Court.
